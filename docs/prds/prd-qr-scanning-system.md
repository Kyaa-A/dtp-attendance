# Product Requirements Document: QR Scanning System

## Introduction/Overview

The QR Scanning System is a core feature of the DTP Attendance application that enables real-time attendance tracking through QR code scanning. This system allows designated organizers to scan student QR codes using their device's camera to record time-in and time-out attendance for specific event sessions. The system automatically determines whether a scan represents a "Time-In" or "Time-Out" based on configurable time windows, eliminating manual selection and reducing errors.

**Problem Statement:** Traditional attendance tracking methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to manage for large events. Manual processes create bottlenecks and make it challenging to track attendance in real-time.

**Solution:** A web-based QR scanning system that provides instant attendance recording with automatic time window detection, real-time feedback, and comprehensive admin management tools.

## Goals

1. **Streamline Attendance Tracking:** Reduce attendance recording time by 80% compared to manual methods
2. **Eliminate Human Error:** Automatically determine Time-In vs Time-Out based on configurable time windows
3. **Enable Real-time Monitoring:** Provide instant feedback and live attendance counts during events
4. **Support Multiple Organizers:** Allow concurrent scanning by multiple organizers without conflicts
5. **Ensure Data Integrity:** Prevent duplicate scans and maintain accurate attendance records
6. **Provide Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate detailed CSV exports for attendance analysis
